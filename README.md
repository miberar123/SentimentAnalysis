# Sentiment Analysis


## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a vital task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text or an image. It has various applications in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research, among others. In our project, we aim to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to classify sentiments in both text and image data.


## Text Data Analysis

### Models:

+ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are particularly well-suited for sequential data like text. They process input data step-by-step while retaining memory of past inputs through hidden states. This capability makes them effective for capturing context and dependencies in text sequences.

+ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks: LSTM networks are another popular choice for text analysis tasks. LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs by introducing a memory cell that can retain information over long sequences. 

+ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): While traditionally used for image processing, CNNs have also shown promise in text classification tasks. By applying convolutions over text embeddings, CNNs can capture local patterns and hierarchical features in textual data.

+ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT, based on the transformer architecture, has revolutionized NLP by capturing bidirectional contextual information from text. It excels in understanding the semantics and nuances of language, making it highly effective for sentiment analysis tasks.


### Approach:

We will preprocess the text data by tokenizing and encoding it using techniques like word embeddings or subword embeddings. These embeddings capture semantic information about words, which is crucial for downstream tasks like sentiment analysis.


## Image Data Analysis

+ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): CNNs are a foundational architecture for image analysis. Within CNNs, we utilized variants like ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and RegNetY-400MF. These CNN architectures are characterized by their deep layers with skip connections, enabling effective feature extraction and hierarchical representation learning. They have been widely adopted for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.

+ CNN from Scratch: This involves training a CNN architecture from scratch, starting with randomly initialized parameters. While this approach allows for customization and fine-tuning to specific datasets, it often requires large amounts of annotated data and considerable computational resources for training.

+ Pre-trained Models: Leveraging pre-trained models such as those trained on large-scale image datasets like ImageNet provides a shortcut to effective feature extraction. These models have already learned rich hierarchical representations from vast amounts of data, enabling transfer learning for downstream tasks like image classification, object detection, and image generation.


## Applications

One potential application of our sentiment analysis system is in social media platforms or chat applications. Given a text input, the system could generate an appropriate image or sticker conveying the sentiment expressed in the text. This can enhance user engagement and communication by adding visual context to textual conversations.


## Conclusion

By combining advanced machine learning models for text and image analysis, our sentiment analysis project aims to provide a holistic understanding of sentiments expressed in various forms of digital content. Through this endeavor, we seek to contribute to the advancement of sentiment analysis techniques and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
